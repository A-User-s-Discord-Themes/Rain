## Settings
Currently you can acess the settings only opening `splash.css` and modifying the values.

## Installation
Before installing the theme, make sure that you have powercord installed. [Instructions here](https://powercord.dev/installation).
Second, run the following commands on terminal:
```sh
cd [powercordDir]/src/Powercord/themes #note: change [powercordDir] to the current directory of powercord
git clone https://github.com/A-User-s-Discord-Themes/Rain.git
```
And you're done. It is not necessary to reload discord, since powercord auto-enables themes and plugins.

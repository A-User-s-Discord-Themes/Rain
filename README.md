## Settings
For now you can acess the settings opening `splash.css` and modifying the vars since powercord (and any mod client for discord) doesn't have settings for themes (spoiler: powercord devs have plans for doing that).

## Installation
Before installing the theme, make sure that you have Powercord installed. [Instructions here](https://powercord.dev/installation).<br>
Second, run the following commands on terminal:
```sh
cd [powercordDir]/src/Powercord/themes #note: change [powercordDir] to the current directory of powercord
git clone https://github.com/A-User-s-Discord-Themes/Rain.git
```
And you're done. It is not necessary to reload discord and enable the theme, since Powercord auto-enables themes and plugins.

## FAQ
`#1` Why I should use Powercord, and not BetterDiscord?<br>
Because powercord is the unique mod client that has support for styling the splash screen for now. If you need help to migrate from BD to Powercord you can use [BDCompat](https://github.com/Juby210/bdCompat) plugin.

`#2` Why a [useless.css](useless.css) file exists?<br>
Powercord only loads themes if it has a key for changing the discord's main interface. So i created the useless.css file to pass this "protection".
